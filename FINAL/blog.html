            <h5>Los Angeles LGBT Center Responds to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Proposed Rule to Legalize Discrimination</h5>
            <div class="recentnewsimg"></div>
            <div class="recentnewstext">
                    <p>May 26 2019</p>
                    <p>In response to today’s U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announcement of their intention to eliminate sexual orientation and gender identity nondiscrimination protections in health care services—including protections in the Affordable Care Act, Qualified Health Plan regulations, and Medicaid—Los Angeles LGBT Center Director of Policy and Community Building Terra Russell-Slavin issued the following statement:</p>
    
                    <p>“Make no mistake: this announcement is yet another attack on the most vulnerable members of the LGBT community. It is part of a systematic effort by the Trump Administration to dehumanize and stigmatize society’s most vulnerable people: women, people of color, immigrants, poor people and, of course, the LGBT community. For LGBT people—and, in particular, the transgender community—it is part of a comprehensive strategy to strip away hard-won protections of the last decade. </p>
                            
                    <p>"Access to health care is a human right. Restricting access to care is cruel and inhumane. The Center stands with scores of other health care providers, LGBT organizations, and our many progressive allies in opposition to this proposed rule change. We call on every elected official of good conscience, regardless of party, to stand up and stop these assaults on the transgender community and all LGBT people.”</p>

                <h5>Los Angeles LGBT Center Mourns the Loss of Three Murdered Black Transgender Women </h5>
                <div class="recentnewsimg2"></div>
                <div class="recentnewstext2">
                        <p>May 24 2019</p>
                        <p>“The Los Angeles LGBT Center mourns the loss of Michelle ‘Tamika’ Washington, Muhlaysia Booker, and Claire Legato—three black transgender women who were murdered in the last two weeks. These murders follow a pattern of increasing and escalating violence against the trans community, especially against black trans women. This increase in transphobia and violence comes at a time when the Trump Administration continues to target the trans community, threatening to roll-back health and housing protections just this week. As a community we must address the underlying conditions, including anti-transgender bias, that result in increased rates of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness for trans women. These conditions increase the risk of violence for all trans women, particularly trans women of color.”</p>
        
                        <p>For those in our community feeling scared or alone, we want you to know that the Los Angeles LGBT Center has the following resources and services for people affected by these recent murders and for anyone who has experienced emotional or physical violence themselves:</p>

                    <h5>Los Angeles LGBT Center To Be Honored With Community Hero Award at Los Angeles Dodgers LGBT Night on May 31 </h5>
                    <div class="recentnewsimg3"></div>
                    <div class="recentnewstext3">

                            <p>May 20 2019</p>
                            <p>Adding to its celebratory 50th anniversary, the Los Angeles LGBT Center—the world’s largest LGBT organization—will be recognized by the Los Angeles Dodgers with the Community Hero Award on Friday, May 31, at Dodger Stadium during the team’s seventh annual LGBT Night. Center Board of Directors member LuAnn Boylan will accept the award on behalf of the Center prior to the Dodgers’ 7:10 p.m. game against the Philadelphia Phillies. </p>
            
                            <p>“We are thrilled to be honored by the Los Angeles Dodgers as part of this special LGBT celebration. Honoring the Center means honoring what we stand for: care and compassion, hope and healing; equality,” said Center CEO Lorri L. Jean. “The Center has been a part of Los Angeles now for 50 years and what better way to celebrate than with our hometown team!”</p>
                                    
                            <p>Military veteran—and a client of the Center’s Senior Services—Bill Anderson will also be honored during the game as the Military Hero of the Game for his service. Anderson served 21 years with the California Army National Guard and achieved the rank of Staff Sergeant. He is one of the first members of the LGBT Military Veteran Colord Guard Detail—the only color guard detail of its kind in the nation.</p>
                                    
                            <p>“The Los Angeles Dodgers organization has long embraced diversity and inclusion, and has also championed those who stand up to help make the community—and the lives of the people within it—better,” said Dodgers Senior Vice President – Marketing, Community & Broadcasting Erik Braverman. “The Los Angeles LGBT Center exemplifies what the Community Hero Award stands for, and the Dodgers are proud to honor the organization, its employees and volunteers for their tireless work on LGBT Night at Dodger Stadium.”</p>
